# **Chrome Fullscreen Search**  

ðŸš€ **Enhance Your Browsing in Fullscreen Mode!**  

## **Why This Exists**  
Google Chromeâ€™s fullscreen mode hides the address bar, making it inconvenient to search or navigate to a new page without exiting fullscreen. This extension provides a **simple, elegant solution**â€”press `Ctrl + L` to bring up a floating search bar!  

## **Features**  
âœ… Works only in fullscreen mode  
âœ… `Ctrl + L` opens a search bar overlay  
âœ… Supports direct URLs and Google searches  
âœ… Press `Esc` to close  

## **How to Use**  
1. Load the extension manually in Chrome:  
   ðŸ‘‰ Follow [Google's guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked) to add an unpacked extension.  
2. Press **`Ctrl + L`** in fullscreen to open the search bar.  
3. Type a **URL** or a **search term** and hit Enter!  

## **Future Scope**  
ðŸ”¹ **Customizable Search Engine** â€“ Right now, it defaults to Google. In the future, users could choose between Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, or others.  
ðŸ”¹ **Dark Mode Toggle** â€“ Better UI customization for light/dark themes.  
ðŸ”¹ **Persistent Search Bar** â€“ Option to pin it in fullscreen mode instead of toggling.  
ðŸ”¹ **Customizable Shortcut Key** â€“ Let users define their own shortcut instead of `Ctrl + L`.  

## **Contribute & Fork**  
This project is **open-source and free for everyone**! Feel free to:  
- **Fork it** and customize it for your needs.  
- **Contribute** by improving the UI, adding features, or fixing bugs.  
- **Share** it with others who might find it useful.  

## **Why No Chrome Web Store?**  
I donâ€™t have $5 for a developer account, so this remains public for anyone to use. If youâ€™d like to officially publish it as a Chrome extension, **go ahead!** ðŸš€
